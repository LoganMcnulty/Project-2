# Vocab-O-Matic

![Logo](/public/images/VOM.png)

Vocab-O-Matic sends targeted curriculum (Reminders) to the email of the parent of an enrolled student. These reminders include a link to a vocabulary interface, of which the student and parent may use to review the curriculum together. The reminders aim to expose students to new words that will help them develop a rich vocabulary. Simply enter your student's name, their grade level, and the frequency of which you'd like to be reminded to review with your student. Vocab-O-Matic will do the rest!
